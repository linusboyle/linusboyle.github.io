title: "Accurate Inference of Termination Conditions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/conditional
excerpt: 'We present the first approach to infer accurate termination conditions of programs. It builds on a simple but effective framework where non-terminating states are iteratively identified and removed, and a termination prover is employed to validate the current condition. We instantiate the framework with data-driven provers and design a multi-way data sharing mechanism to enhance their interaction. Our proofs show that this method is correct, accurate, terminating, and relatively complete. Additionally, we introduce generalization techniques for recurrent sets to accelerate the iteration process. Evaluation on a benchmark of programs from the literature shows that our implementation significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art tool Acabar, producing much more accurate termination conditions, with the proposed techniques playing a crucial role in speeding up the convergence of the process.'
