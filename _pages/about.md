Hi There!

I'm a PhD candidate at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, and a member of the [Formal Verification Group](https://thufv.github.io/). I'm supervised by Prof. [Fei He](https://feihe.github.io/). My current research interests are automated program analysis and verification, and to develop both theoretical and practical tools for establishing software safety. I'm also interested in broad topics about programming languages and computational logics.

I graduated from the [Department of Computer Science and Techonology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) of Tsinghua University. Previously, I have done researches on formally verified compiler for synchronous data-flow language (Lustre), and string constriants solving (check out our string solver [OSTRICH](https://github.com/uuverifiers/ostrich)!) under supervision of [Shengyuan Wang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1112/3496.htm) and [Zhilin Wu](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wuzl/index.html) respectively.

For more information, you may take a look at my [blog](https://garden.linusboyle.cn) (it's mainly in Chinese).
