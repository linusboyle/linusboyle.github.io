Hi There!

I'm a first-year PhD student at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of Tsinghua University and a member of the [Formal Verification Group](https://thufv.github.io/). I'm supervised by Prof. [Fei He](https://feihe.github.io/). My current research interests are automated program analysis and verification, and to develop both theoretical and practical tools for establishing software safety. More generally, I'm also interested in many topics about programming languages and computational logics.

I received BS from the [Department of Computer Science and Techonology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) of Tsinghua University. Previously, I have done researches on formally verified compiler for synchronous data-flow language (Lustre), and constraints solving problem of string theory (check out our string solver [OSTRICH](https://github.com/uuverifiers/ostrich)!). I'm grateful for my previous advisor [Shengyuan Wang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1112/3496.htm) and [Zhilin Wu](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wuzl/index.html).
